# Asteroid Dodger
*Repository for my final project for CS50x 2020, a game made with the LOVE engine.*
## About
This project, titled Asteroid Dodger, was my chosen final project for the HarvardX CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course, which I took online in 2020. This project will not be further updated.
Asteroid Dodger requires the LOVE engine to be installed and can be run by dragging the `final_proect` folder over the `LOVE.exe` executable and releasing it to open the project with LOVE.
The game is about moving a small spaceship around the screen, dodging incoming asteroids of varying speeds and sizes.
## Controls
- `ENTER` to begin the game
